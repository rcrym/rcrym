# Hello, I'm Riley.

I am an engineering student with seven years of software development experience gained through academic coursework, personal projects, and internships. My focus is on fullstack web development, but I also have strong experience with apps, robotics, web crawling, embedded systems, natural language processing, and more.

Below is a summary of the technologies and languages that I have utilized across various projects:
