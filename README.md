# Hello, I'm Riley.

I'm an engineering student at UBC and have been developing software since high school—about 7 years in total—including internships, coursework, and personal projects. My focus is on fullstack software development, with experience spanning web applications, embedded systems, robotics, and natural language processing.

### Technologies and Tools
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Firebase, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, Java, VHDL, Assembly
- **Other Tools:** Docker, GCP, AWS, Puppeteer, Pinecone

### So Far
- **Fullstack Web Applications:** Built fullstack Next.js apps with authentication and custom backend servers for frontend integration.
- **UBC Workday Extension:** Developed a Chrome extension used by over 8,000 students for streamlined university scheduling.
- **Embedded Systems (Skyfall):** Developed ESP32 firmware for real-time drone fall detection and parachute deployment, streaming telemetry via WebSocket to a live dashboard.
- **Automation Engineering:** Built web crawlers and scraping pipelines with Cheerio and Puppeteer for real-time data collection.
- **Physics-Based Simulations:** Modeled 2D rigid body dynamics, aerodynamics, and fluid dynamics in academic projects.
